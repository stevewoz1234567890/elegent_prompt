🔥 10 prompts that make Claude write like a human (not a robot):

1. The Coffee Shop Test

"Write this like you're explaining it to a friend over coffee. No marketing speak. No corporate jargon. Just straight talk about [topic]. If it sounds like a LinkedIn post, rewrite it."

2. Voice Finder

"Give me 5 different ways to say this same idea. Make each one sound like a different person wrote it - one cynical, one excited, one skeptical, one matter-of-fact, one surprised."

3. AI Word Assassin

"Rewrite this without any words that appear in typical AI-generated content. Ban these: 'delve', 'crucial', 'leverage', 'landscape', 'robust', 'game-changer'. Use conversational alternatives."

4. Twitter Fight Mode

"Write this like you're responding to someone who challenged you on Twitter. Keep it factual but add personality. Show some edge without being aggressive."

5. Story Time Formula

"Take this topic and write it like you're telling a story about something that just happened to you. Start with 'This is wild' or 'Holy shit' or 'Okay so'. Make it feel spontaneous."

6. Rhythm Master

"Write this in short, punchy sentences. Max 15 words per sentence. Vary the rhythm - some super short (3-5 words), some medium (8-12 words). Never three long sentences in a row."

7. Pattern Interrupt

"Add one unexpected comparison or analogy that makes people stop scrolling. Don't use common comparisons. Make it weird but accurate. Something that makes people think 'huh, never thought of it that way.'"

8. Fluff Destroyer

"Remove every adjective and adverb that doesn't add new information. If 'very' or 'really' or 'extremely' appears, cut it or replace with a stronger verb. Show, don't tell."

9. Contrarian Angle

"Write this like you're contradicting conventional wisdom. Lead with what everyone gets wrong, then explain what's actually true. Make it feel like you're letting someone in on a secret."

10. Specificity Machine

"Take this draft and add 3 specific examples or numbers. Replace every vague claim with concrete evidence. If you can't find real data, flag it so I can add it manually."
