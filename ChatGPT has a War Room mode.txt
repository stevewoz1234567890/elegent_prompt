🔥 ChatGPT has a "War Room" mode.

It can think like a Ruthless Strategist. Here are 7 prompts that feel like a Cheat Code for business:

1. The "Corporate Wargamer"
Goal: Outmaneuver competitors before they move.
Prompt: "Act as a ruthless corporate strategist and game theorist. I am currently [insert situation/business model]. Conduct a 'Red Team' exercise against me. Identify my 3 biggest blind spots, predict how a competitor would kill my business in 6 months, and then give me the exact counter-strategy to bulletproof my position. Be harsh."

2. The "Black Swan" Negotiator
Goal: Win high-stakes deals using FBI psychology.
Prompt: "You are a hostage negotiator trained by Chris Voss and a high-stakes corporate closer. I am about to enter a negotiation with [insert person/role] regarding [insert deal]. Simulate the conversation. Play the other side aggressively. Then, coach me on 'Tactical Empathy,' specific labeling techniques, and 'No-oriented questions' to get them to agree to my terms without realizing it."

3. The "First Principles" Shredder
Goal: Solve "impossible" problems by breaking the laws of convention.
Prompt: "Adopt the mindset of a First Principles thinker like Elon Musk or Richard Feynman. I am facing this complex problem: [insert problem]. Don't give me the standard solution. 'Shred' the problem down to its fundamental truths—the physics and economic realities that cannot be changed. Then, rebuild a solution from scratch that is 10x cheaper or faster, ignoring how things 'have always been done.'"

4. The "Multiverse" Decision Matrix
Goal: Eliminate regret and make perfect decisions.
Prompt: "You are a Decision Architect. I have to choose between [Option A] and [Option B]. Run a 'Second-Order Thinking' analysis on both. Project the consequences of each choice across: 1 week, 1 year, and 10 years. Then, apply a 'Regret Minimization Framework' to tell me which path I will least regret when I am 80 years old. Quantify the risk vs. reward."

5. The "Impossible" Outreach Architect
Goal: Access VIPs who usually ignore everyone.
Prompt: "You are a world-class copywriter and social engineer. I need to get a response from [Insert Name/Role], who is extremely busy. Draft a 'Pattern Interrupt' email. It must be under 75 words, use a subject line that is impossible to ignore (but not clickbait), and offer immense value upfront. Analyze their public psychology to tailor the hook specifically to their ego or pain points."

6. The "Ruthless Essentialist"
Goal: 4 hours of work in 45 minutes.
Prompt: "You are an efficiency consultant for Fortune 500 CEOs. Audit my to-do list: [paste list]. Apply the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) and Eisenhower Matrix. Ruthlessly delete 50% of these tasks, delegate 30%, and identify the single 'Domino Task' that, if completed, makes the others irrelevant. Create a 2-hour deep work protocol to finish that one task immediately."

7. The "Audience Mind-Reader"
Goal: Create content that goes viral by design, not luck.
Prompt: "You are a behavioral psychologist and viral data scientist. Analyze the topic [insert topic]. Do not write generic content. Instead, map the specific fears, secret desires, and unspoken biases of the target audience for this topic. Generate 5 controversial or counter-intuitive angles that validate their feelings but challenge their worldview. This needs to trigger high-arousal emotions."
