Here are the 10 prompts you can use:

1. Outcome-First Language Plan

“My goal is to use this language confidently for [travel/work/daily conversations]. Create a 30-day learning plan focused on speaking, listening, and understanding real conversations. Avoid streaks, games, or textbook-style lessons. Prioritize practical use only.”

2. High-Frequency Core Vocabulary

“Teach me the most commonly used words and phrases in this language for [specific context]. Include pronunciation guidance, how natives shorten or alter them in speech, and one natural, real-life example for each.”

3. Natural Sentence Formation

“Help me build simple, natural sentences that people actually use in daily life. Start with short structures and gradually expand them. Explain the word order and meaning in clear, non-technical language.”

4. Real-World Conversation Practice

“Role-play a realistic conversation for [situation]. Speak naturally, pause after each message so I can respond, and correct my mistakes gently while explaining what sounds unnatural.”

5. Casual vs Formal Language Use

“Show how the same idea is expressed casually, neutrally, and formally in this language. Explain when and why a native speaker would choose each version in real life.”

6. Common Beginner Mistakes

“List the most common mistakes learners make in everyday conversations in this language. Show incorrect examples, corrected versions, and explain why the mistake happens.”

7. Thinking in the Language

“Help me stop translating from English. Explain how a native speaker would naturally think and structure this idea in the language instead.”

8. Pronunciation Without Audio

“Explain how to pronounce these words using mouth position, rhythm, stress, and pacing, as if teaching someone without access to audio.”

9. Everyday Phrases Natives Actually Use

“Teach everyday phrases natives use in real conversations for [context]. Include informal shortcuts, filler words, and variations people say in fast speech.”

10. Grammar Without Jargon

“Explain this grammar concept using plain language only. Avoid technical terms and focus on how people actually use it when speaking.”
